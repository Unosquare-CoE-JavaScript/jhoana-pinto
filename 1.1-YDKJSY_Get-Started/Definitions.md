## Definitions for chapter 1

**TC39:** Technical Committee number 39 (In charge of standarization of JS language under the "ECMAScript" specification)

**DX:** Developer Experience

**Paradigm:** e.g.- Functional programming and OOP

**Backwards compatibility:** once something is accepted
as valid JS, there will not be a future change to the language that causes that code to become invalid JS.

**Forward compatibility:** including a new addition to the language in a program would not cause that program to break if it were run in an older JS engine. ***JS is not forwards-compatible***

**Transpiling:** using a tool to convert the source code of a program from one form to another. *e.g. Babel*

**Polifill:** used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it. *e.g. Shim*

**Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):** is the result of parsing code. For JavaScript, an AST is a JavaScript object containing a tree representation of your source.
