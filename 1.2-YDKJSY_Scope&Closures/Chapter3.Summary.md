# Chapter 3: The Scope Chain

- **Shadowing:** when you declare a variable with the same name in differents scopes. Because the variables exists in different scopes eachone has its own value unaffected.

- a *let/const* can shadow a *var* but a *var* cannot shadow a *let/const* unless there's a function boundary in between.
